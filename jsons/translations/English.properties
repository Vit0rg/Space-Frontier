#################### GENERAL TEXT ####################
TXT_KEY_DAWN_OF_MAN_TEXT = Communications with Earth have gone silent. Scheduled cargo ships have not arrived as expected, nor have any sent in the last two months returned. The People's Democracy of Earth (PDE) starships previously stationed in the vicinity returned to search for the cause, but they too have not been heard from since their departure. At this point we have no answers. Production levels of food and supplies in the Colony remain stable and should this be a prolonged situation we appear to be in no danger. However, the political impact may be more profound. Agitation with the PDE's firm grip over Colonial affairs has been on the rise. The current situation, coupled with increased local sentiment to break with the PDE, provides us the opportunity to free ourselves of their grasp. Further complicating the situation, the status of the other Colonies remains unknown due to the PDE monopoly over all communications and interstellar travel.

TECH_QUOTE_0 = "By the mid-twenty-first century, the progress of humanity seemed to march on endlessly. Hunger, disease and war all appeared to be on the decline. Democracy was spreading and fewer totalitarian states remained than at any previous point in history. By anyone's observation, it was clear that mankind appeared to be in the midst of a golden age."\n\n- Encyclopediae Galactica, History of the Earth and its Colonies
TECH_QUOTE_1 = "2058 AD was to be an infamous year. A massive drought plagued the Earth; particularly hard-hit were areas near the equator. A devastating famine ensued and millions died. By this point in time the reliance of the industrialized countries on the resources of poorer nations was inescapable. The impact on the global economy was profound, and even rich countries saw hard times. Wealthy investors found themselves holding worthless shreds of paper which once had been worth fortunes. Accompanying this series of catastrophes was another great tragedy. The American city of New York was devastated in the first incidence of nuclear terrorism."\n\n- Encyclopediae Galactica, History of the Earth and its Colonies

The process of industrialization Third World nations engaged in during the 20th century has contributed significantly to this, but particularly disturbing is the average recorded level of 20 microroentgens of radiation in the atmosphere (outside of the North American and East Asian territories, where levels are obviously much higher). This figure is up from an average level of 1.2 nearly ten years ago. While this in itself is not enough to cause major problems for humans, it is evident of a growing ecological disaster which we will one day have to confront."\n\n- UN Committee on World Ecology Health, Report, July 23rd, 2080 AD
TECH_QUOTE_4 = "We live today in a world of misery and tragedy. What hope do we have when all around us we find famine, war and destruction? The truth is, there is indeed little in what surrounds us that should give us cause to celebrate. Where then do men look for hope? It is only God who promises us a bright future. For even when the walls around us collapse and we are left alone in this world, He shall welcome us into His embrace. It must be our faith that we cling to in times of darkness, for that is the one thing this existence can never take from us."\n\n- Revivalist Journal, Spring 2090 AD Issue
TECH_QUOTE_5 = "This world is filled with the governments of corrupt men. It should be our government that we can turn to provide us with that which we lack. But in these dark times the leaders of today are interested more in self-preservation than in providing for those in need. It is the responsibility of the people to ensure that their government is serving them, rather than the opposite. Now is the time for change, my friends! It is only we who can make this spoiled land pure again, to give hope when all hope is gone.

TECH_QUOTE_7 = "Since the establishment of the WRF nearly eight years ago by the recently-departed Charles Vincent, the organization has met with great success in its mission. With operations on five continents, the progress the WRF has made in providing much-needed food and supplies as well as psychological support to those who lack such things has been well beyond expectations. But more than that, the WRF has served as a rallying point for both those who wish to provide help and those who need it.

TECH_QUOTE_8 = "It is clear what's going on here. The governments of the world, if you can really call them that, are afraid of the potent words my brother spoke in his travels, and the beliefs he espoused and the movement which resulted. The WRF has reached out to people, and now children have streets to walk on, schools to go to, clean water to drink. But the big men in power are afraid of that.

Lacking a centralized structure and supported by the people, the WRF and WLA proved an impossible foe for its enemies to target with either armies or nuclear weapons. Already wracked with turmoil, facing economic collapse and trying to prop up increasingly unpopular policies, most governments found the prospect of fighting a guerilla war against a phantom enemy impossible. Most collapsed within ten years of the outbreak of conflict, and as the WLA gained momentum even the most stalwart fortresses were unable to hold for long."\n\n- Encyclopediae Galactica, History of the Earth and its Colonies

We must strive to look beyond, to make more of our world and accomplish that which we could never have done before.

TECH_QUOTE_17 = "The foundation of the Space Exploration and Colonization Initiative (or SECI) as part of the IASR has provided me and my team with an excellent outlet for creative science. One of the more exciting developments we have been investigating is the possibility of Faster-Than-Light travel. As everyone knows, the closest star is an immense distance from the Earth. We are looking for ways to traverse that distance. One of the more unique ideas has been the creation of some sort of drive which harnesses the power of negative energy to, not necessarily move some object faster than light, but move space-time itself around the object! Of course negative energy isn't something you can find at the supermarket... the costs to manufacture and maintain this technology is immense - but so too are the potential rewards. I'm confident that, thanks to the generous funding provided by the IASR, we'll find a way."\n\n- Jian Shen, SECI Research into FTL Transportation, 2165 AD
TECH_QUOTE_18 = "One of SECI's primary ongoing research projects is the development of new ways to sustain human life in hostile environments. This will prove useful both here on Earth in highly irradiated areas, as well as in any future interplanetary colonization attempts. There's very little room for error in this field: humans need to eat and sleep, and they also need protection from extreme heat, cold and radiation. None of these are especially difficult engineering challenges: the trick is to execute them in a way that is economically viable.  Fortunately we have developed new synthetic materials which are highly resistant to hazardous surroundings. Large-scale testing will commence soon, and we are hopeful that these efforts will bear fruit within a few years."\n\n- SECI, Advances in Habitation Technology, May 2166 AD Report

TECH_QUOTE_27 = "While the value of establishing new interstellar colonies is certainly not in question, it presents a number of new problems that this department must find a way to address. Limitations of our communications technology seriously handicap our ability to effectively administer a state which spans multiple star systems. At present we use a "pony express" style of couriers between star systems, but as we expand the delays inherent in this system are becoming intolerable: a sun could begin to go nova and threaten an entire system, and it might be too late before we knew about it. With a centralized government such as ours the challenges posed by remote, alien and hostile environments require rapid response, and we are unable to provide it. We could provide the local governing bodies with more resources and greater autonomy to face these challenges on their own, but to do so risks the eventual splintering of human space into hundreds of independent quarreling states, all seeking domination over one-another, potentially unleashing war on a scale never before seen in human history.

#################### Civ Pedia Entries ####################
CIVILIZATION_NEW_EARTH_PEDIA = With much fanfare and high hopes, New Earth was established in 2239 AD as the first human Colony beyond their solar system of origin. As the first human settlement outside of Sol system, it received a large percentage of the early technological and economic support of the Earth for the Colonization movement. Because of this it began the post-Earth era with a more advanced industrial base than the other Colonies. The Radar Polymers technology it starts with allows immediate construction of Scout ships, giving it a major early advantage in space exploration. Because it's been around longer, New Earth's population is higher than that of the other Colonies.\nNew Earth had a tight-knit relationship with the home planet prior to communications being lost. The inhabitants of the Colony consider it an extension of the Earth and pride themselves on keeping the Colony culturally in step with the mother world. As the oldest Colony, New Earth was granted number of privileges the others did not receive, including greater autonomy and more advantageous trade agreements. However, despite its near-slavish loyalty New Earth was still viewed with distrust by the PDE ruling elite and was (officially) allowed to possess no starships of its own. In many ways, New Earth found itself even more helpless than the other Colonies when contact with Earth was lost. It must now shake the dependency of the past and learn to survive on its own.
CIVILIZATION_BROTHERHOOD_PEDIA = Rising to power in an unorthodox manner, the Brotherhood gained a foothold on their home planet of Phyrus only recently. The Colony on Phyrus was founded in 2271 AD, making it one of the youngest Colonies to survive the loss of contact with the Earth. The first settlement was a political prisoner facility, designed to contain the 'undesirables' in a pseudo-labor camp setup, far from anywhere they could cause problems. This establishment broke down a few years later after it was discovered that running the Colony in such a manner was not economically viable, and Phyrus would need to be restructured to survive. The Colony was reorganized into a civil settlement, although elements of the recently released prisoners remained embittered even after gaining freedom in 2279. The Brotherhood was founded as a means for these disgruntled elements to organize and undermine Earth-based rule of their planet by any means possible.\nThe next 20 years saw dissidence growing rapidly within the population of Phyrus. When contact with Earth was lost in 2302 AD and security forces were drawn away from the planet to investigate, the powder keg erupted and the Brotherhood quickly took control. Designed with a more 'communal' structure, a free republic was proclaimed, and the Brotherhood commenced the training of soldiers and collected arms of all sorts, expecting a violent response from PDE forces which never came.
CIVILIZATION_AVOWERS_PEDIA = The Avowers of Knowledge, or simply the Avowers, are an organization tasked with the administration of Research Colony 1, or RC-1. An experimental base initially, RC-1 was among the first Colonies founded, created in 2252 AD primarily as a research facility. The boom of interest in interstellar exploration and Colonization saw the Colony transformed into a popular settlement destination, as it was one of the few known habitable worlds at the time. The research lab remained the primary hub of activity on RC-1 even after the population began growing rapidly. The foundation charged with administrating the base also essentially served as the Colony's government. Officially, they are known simply as the "RC-1 Administrative Unit", but are colloquially and somewhat jokingly known as the "Avowers of Knowledge" for how seriously they take their tasks.\nThe Avowers possess an impressive scientific heritage. Their belief in the importance of research has led to the foundation of a very well-funded education program, giving the Avowers a distinctive advantage over other known Colonies with regards to future development of technology. Much of RC-1's culture and economy is linked to the research labs, although generally the control the Avowers exercise over the inhabitants of RC-1 is relatively lax. Government attention is primarily paid to meeting the basic living needs of the populace and to ensure that the scientific facilities remain in perfect working order.
CIVILIZATION_THE_FORGE_PEDIA = It is the nature of the Forge's existence which brought the Colony its name. The second human interstellar settlement, founded in 2247 AD, the planet was targeted for Colonization to serve as a mining facility. Initial probe sweeps in the region found highly concentrated deposits of rare minerals near the surface of the world, making it a highly attractive target. With interest in Colonization increasing rapidly, metals were becoming more and more rare on Earth, particularly those metals necessary to construct the impressive starships of the PDE's interstellar Colonization fleet.\nThe Forge grew rapidly as a center for mining and, as the population grew, industry and manufacturing as well. The Forge prospered as a well-traveled world, enjoying the success of a profitable economic exchange with Earth. The development of "Core Drillers" to extract minerals from the molten center of planets in 2264 had a damaging impact on the Forge's economy, as its industry relied on more traditional mining methods. However, Core Driller technology was proven unsound when the planets which housed them began suffering catastrophic collapses, and the Forge regained its position as the most significant mining Colony.\nThe loss of the mineral and heavy industry trade in 2302 has had a damaging impact on the planet's economy. However, the Forge is fortunately well-equipped for survival with its wide array of hi-tech equipment and construction facilities. It must now use those resources to ensure the survival and prosperity of the Colony, rather than to gather wealth through the trade which dominated its past. The only real concern for the Forge is staving off food and supply shortages, as the Forge relied heavily on procuring such goods from trade with the Earth.
CIVILIZATION_PARADISE_PEDIA = The Colony of Paradise was founded in 2256 AD, essentially, as an exotic resort location among the stars. Realizing there were lucrative opportunities to offer a "vacation location" for the well-to-do wishing to get away from the struggling Earth, a number of entrepreneurs provided the funding for the Colony's creation. Unlike most Colonies, Paradise was run completely as a private commercial venture for many of its early years. The population remained small and highly exclusive during this time, but a severe drought on Earth in 2268 AD saw massive demand for colonization. The other Colonies of the time were already at capacity and only Paradise was capable of supporting a large influx of people. While there had been fairly stringent restrictions on who was allowed into the Colony prior to this, the potential financial gain presented by this situation was enough to convince the ruling oligarchy to open passage - for a price. Often expending their life savings, many non-wealthy families traveled to Paradise, having heard stories of its grandeur.\nBecause of its history, Paradise is very much stratified in terms of social class. On one side of the spectrum exists the wealthy ruling class which laid the foundation for the Colony. Their focus on the luxuries of life has led to an increased level of cultural and scientific development. On the other side of the coin is the large group of new immigrants with little capital and few rights. Displeased with the prevailing situation, grumblings can be heard from the oppressed masses, which may suggest something serious hiding in the shadows of Paradise's society. The disappearance of Earth has brought the brewing social conflict to a head, and Paradise must trust in its leader, Leonard Pritchard, to mend the wounds of the Colony and bring true greatness to it.
CIVILIZATION_HALIS_PEDIA = The Halis Planned State, or simply Halis as it's usually called, grew out of the first group of Colonists who landed on the planet of the same name. Founded in 2261 AD, the original group of settlers met with uncharacteristically severe environmental and economic hardships upon arrival. Many Colonists died as the result of natural disasters, famine and disease, and extreme measures were undertaken to ensure the survival of Halis' new inhabitants. Food rations were cut, luxuries forbidden, law enforcement stepped up. Disobedience or criminal activity was severely punished and any dissidence quelled immediately. As a result, Halis survived, but the effects on its society were profound. Even following the end of the initial hardships, the rigid ruling structure which had dominated the Colony remained in place.\nIn many ways this both added to and detracted from Halis' future success. With a more orderly and obedient populace, even radical changes deemed necessary by the Colonial government could be introduced with little resistance. However, the lack of freedom limited expression and this has had a significant impact on the cultural and social development of Halis. Due to the highly centralized nature of the Colony, the loss of contact with Earth hardly fazed it. The only challenging question for Halis to address is what their people's fate beyond the boundaries of their home planet might be.
CIVILIZATION_RED_SYNDICATE_PEDIA = Among the youngest of the human Colonies to survive cut off from the Earth, Crossroads was created in 2265 AD for the sole purpose of, as its name suggests, serving as a trade hub for other Colonies. Acting as the warehouse and supply depot of the stars meant that economics played a significant role in the development of Crossroads. As with all human economic activity, a darker side of the economic market emerged, and a powerful organization known as the "Red Syndicate" gradually extended its grasp over the trade of the colony. Originally a private, capitalistic-owned settlement under the supervision of the PDE, Crossroads fell increasingly under the sway of the Red Syndicate. The population steadily increased along with the monetary success the Colony enjoyed, and many immigrants, particularly the less fortunate, were quick to join the Syndicate as it promised protection and comfort for those who gave it their obedience.\nIn 2302 after one month with no word from Earth, the Red Syndicate under Vladimir Korovin enacted a complete takeover of Crossroads. In truth, this meant very little actually changed, as the Syndicate's influence was already far-reaching. With the Colony was now officially under its control, the Syndicate began to lay plans to extend its power beyond a single world.
CIVILIZATION_ASTROTECH_PEDIA = The Astrotech Corporation was founded as a PDE subcontractor in 2247 AD to develop new forms of technology for the PDE. In order to expand its research capabilities it was moved to the newly-founded Colony of Isaris in 2254 AD. With the resources of a whole Colony and limited supervision, it was hoped that Astrotech would provide a vast array of new if perhaps controversial technologies with which to extend Earth's dominance. Originally, many projects did result in great breakthroughs that allowed for faster starships, cheaper and more effective life support systems and new construction materials.\nThis pace of development would not last forever. Astrotech productivity began to drop off about 30 years after moving to Isaris. It was explained as the result of rising development costs and the increasing complexity of perfecting new technologies. In actuality, Astrotech had been subverted by a group of ambitious and wealthy businessmen. Over time they infiltrated the corporation and, using their financial might, eventually took it over outright. It was not long after this that project funding was diverted into more military-based research - in secret. When communications with Earth ceased in 2302, complete control of Isaris had been achieved, but the ultimate goal was much greater. Knowing that humanity's defenses were weak across the board, the role of the new weapons Astrotech sought to deploy was no less than to be the tools with which to forge an interstellar empire.

LEADER_HECTOR_ALVAREZ_PEDIA = As the leader of New Earth, Hector Alvarez is known to have originated from mankind's homeworld itself, rather than being a native-born inhabitant. He was transferred to New Earth nearly five years ago to serve as its ruling Magistrate. Fiercely loyal to his home planet, Alvarez believes that New Earth represents the true legitimate authority in the universe as a part of the Earth itself. As such, he feigns diplomacy with rebels over a more direct approach... non-loyal factions are in the way and require elimination. In the face of greater strength, Alvarez is out of his element.\nDespite his flaws, Alvarez is an able administrator, and his goal is to make New Earth into a model society: an advanced bastion of technological research, with a universally-recognized culture and - if necessary - military might. However, the zeal Alvarez holds for his pet projects often draws scrutiny, and while able to motivate New Earth's citizens to accomplish more than thought possible, he also creates numerous enemies in the process.
LEADER_LUKAS_VON_REUTHER_PEDIA = Lukas von Reuther is the charismatic leader of the Brotherhood. One of its founding members, he is primarily responsible for organizing and transforming the group into an efficient tool with which to resist the PDE on Phyrus. Famed for being ruthless towards those who oppose him, he is also known to be staunchly loyal to those who prove themselves worthy of his trust.\nVon Reuther's primary aims are to ensure the liberty and security of his Colony. As one of the original political prisoners sent to Phyrus, his experience dealing with the PDE and years of suffering their exploitation has brought him to the conclusion that the evils in this world can only be vanquished in bloody conflict where one side must be destroyed.
LEADER_LU_TIANQU_PEDIA = Lu Tianqu is currently the appointed head of the RC-1 Administrative Unit's secretariat division, entrusted with overall day-to-day colonial operations. His term as Administrator began in 2296 AD, six years prior to contact being lost with Earth. Known for his relatively relaxed attitude, Tianqu is famed for his amiable personality and ability to get his way without much of a fight. The Avowers and RC-1 have enjoyed great success under his leadership thus far, but some question his ability to deal with the serious problems associated with a harsh existence removed from the Earth.
LEADER_JOHN_RICHARDS_PEDIA = John Richards is a native inhabitant of the Forge and worked most of his life in the mining facilities which dominate the planet. As a laborer, he saw the constant exploitation of the Forge by the PDE in order to further its aims. Slowly working his way through the ranks, Richards rose into a management position within the facility and then advanced still further, becoming the Overseer of complete Colony operations. Known to be stubborn and unyielding on many issues, he believes that the virtue of hard work will unlock any door. He respects the strength of others and has little patience for those he sees as weak. With the loss of contact with the Earth he has prepared himself and his Colony to cut loose the PDE and eliminate its influence wherever it might be found.
LEADER_LEONARD_PRITCHARD_PEDIA = Elected from within the ruling oligarchy of Paradise, Sir Leonard Pritchard is currently entrusted with leadership of the Colony. One of the youngest members of the oligarchy, he was born on Paradise and is part of the new generation of the privileged class. More idealistic than his predecessors, he abhors the current rift within Paradise's society. He seeks to integrate the two groups into a combined culture, all without arousing the fury of one, the other or both. He favors the use of diplomacy to solve problems over a show of force. However, even his skills as a diplomat are not enough to keep both sides happy all the time. Pritchard has begun instituting a public works project to win the favor of the lower classes, but this has attracted the ire of the oligarchy, which questions his wasting of the Colonial treasury on mere plebes.
LEADER_KANJI_TAKENO_PEDIA = Kanji Takeno grew up during the hardest times of Halis' early struggles, and this has very much shaped his leadership style. His parents were part of the initial wave of settlers and after their tragic deaths in the early years he was raised by the governor and his family. It was there that he developed his sense of civic duty and was groomed into a future political leader. Firm and unyielding, he controls all of Halis with an iron fist, ensuring deliveries are on time, economic negotiations are completed, dissidents punished and storehouses well-stocked. His great loyalty to Halis and desire to see it succeed and flourish has resulted in the Colony meeting with a great deal of success since he assumed the role of governor in 2294 AD.
LEADER_VLADIMIR_KOROVIN_PEDIA = Vladimir Korovin became the head of the Red Syndicate in 2296 AD, and led it in a takeover of the planet of Crossroads in 2302. His origin is unknown, and it has been debated whether he is from Crossroads itself or came from the Earth originally. His charismatic, lead-from-the-front personality and ability to talk his way out of problems saw him quickly rise through the ranks to eventually become the head of the Syndicate.\nKorovin's primary aim is to aquire money. He believes that wealth can be used to obtain anything man desires in this universe, and with enough cash one can colonize any Star System, construct any great project or build an army mighty enough to defeat any foe. Despite being the leader of an organization with somewhat questionable motives, he is known to be very friendly and accommodating, most likely for the purposes of convincing his potential business partners to want what he wants. Korovin is willing to make any deal or back any associate... if the price is right.
LEADER_RAUL_COLOMBO_PEDIA = As the present-day Chairman of Astrotech Corporation, Raul Colombo was instrumental in the takeover of the company and Isaris as a whole. Numerous colonization-based business interests on Earth netted him an immense fortune in the early years of the race for the stars. He became privy to the existence of Astrotech through one of his deals when a number of highly expensive illicit items were sold to a mysterious buyer in one of the Colonies. Through investigation, records of the company and its secret, privileged status were discovered. Eager to exploit a ripe opportunity when he saw it, Colombo and some of his associates made the necessary backdoor arrangements to travel to Isaris and transfer into the corporation.\nOver the course of several years, Colombo achieved the complete infiltration of Astrotech through threats, bribes and promises, and by 2295 Colombo was voted Chairman of the Board and acting operational officer. He redirected funding towards a more martial goal, and several military research projects were begun. It was known that PDE forces were extremely sparse, and for good reason as it was assumed there was no interstellar threat. Only weakly-armed Police Ships had been built by the PDE in any real numbers, and these were constructed only with the goal of addressing potential trade ship mutinies or other minor disturbances. Colombo diverted an immense sum of money to the creation of new weapons in hopes of carving out his own interstellar empire, one day striking a lightning blow to the Earth from which it could never recover. The seeming disappearance of the Earth caused a change in plans, but effectively only further invited Colombo to enact his unscrupulous machinations upon an unsuspecting universe.
#################### Unit Pedia & Strategy ####################
UNIT_COLONY_SHIP_PEDIA = The Colony Ship is the unit which colonizes Stars and extends the control of a civilization. Carrying hardy adventurers, these ships are expected to turn a previously uninhabited Star System into a productive bastion of humanity. Incapable of defending themselves, the Colony Ships' role is highly specialized but vital to the survival and success of any civilization. These ships became a common sight during the colonization boom of the 23rd century, but their great expense and government ownership meant most were stationed at the PDE Earth headquarters, and were not seen from following the loss of contact. They represent the hope in a brighter future for all of mankind.
UNIT_CONSTRUCT_SHIP_PEDIA = The Construction Ship is the laborer of the vast expanse of space. Tasked with the job of building all of man's projects beyond the reach of planet-based equipment, the Construction Ship is vital to the development of a proper space empire. Their use was limited in the early years of human interstellar colonization, but as more elaborate space-based structures were required to develop and maintain its new Colonies, the PDE was forced to invest in these expensive, but necessary vessels. Capable of completing a number of tasks, the Construction Ship can build Warp Lanes and Jump Lanes, which decrease the travel-time of all starships. Extraction Facilities, built by Construction Ships, are required to exploit resources found in Asteroid fields. And finally, the mighty Starbase must be built by these ships.
UNIT_PLANETARY_DEFENSE_PEDIA = As mankind spread its influence among the stars, the new Colonies began to amass wealth and power, and as is always the case, the need arose to defend these treasures from would-be pirates and thieves. Initially ships of all sorts were armed with projectile weapons and small missiles as a stopgap measure, but it became clear that these makeshift war-craft could not stand up against a determined and better-armed opponent. This led to the first large-scale development of dedicated military vessels. To reduce weight the earliest ships were fitted with inferior weapons and armor, sacrificing armaments for speed and maneuverability. Eventually some ships would be equipped with more powerful weaponry and tougher armor - though slower and less maneuverable, these "Planetary Defense" Ships were far better suited to defend fixed positions such as Star Systems and planets.
UNIT_INVASION_SHIP_PEDIA = The colonization of space has led to a whole new set of military problems not found in terrestrial warfare. One such problem was how to best deliver troops to an enemy planet. In the earliest days of interstellar warfare, a planet's defense rested exclusively on its defending spacecraft and other space-based weaponry; once these were destroyed ships could land on the planet without much risk. However, when nations began establishing planet-based defenses to prevent these attacks, invasion became more difficult. The response was the creation of specialized Invasion Ships. Fitted with extra armor to survive the descent towards a Star System's planets, the primary goal of these slow ships is to capture enemy Star Systems. While not as powerful as other craft, their low cost makes them a highly attractive option for use in en masse planetary assault.
UNIT_SPACE_FIGHTER_PEDIA = The Fighter was developed in response to the increasing threat to larger ships posed by Bomber Squadrons. While Destroyers were fitted with weapons to counter Bombers, they could not be effectively deployed until the enemies were dangerously close. The Fighter was created as a faster, more maneuverable spacecraft able to take on the enemy before it got within bombing range. Fighters were later also fitted with weapons that might cause some damage to larger ships, and their role now includes defending against Bombers, clearing the way for one's own Bombers, light assault and reconnaissance.
UNIT_SPACE_BOMBER_PEDIA = When more powerful weapons became smaller, a new spacecraft philosophy emerged: create a weapons platform as small, fast and inexpensive as possible but still capable of delivering a deadly payload. The ion torpedo proved the perfect armament and the first Space Bombers were created. The Space Bomber is a small spacecraft, similar in design and utility to the aircraft which had seen use on Earth for centuries. Being smaller in size and having weaker weapons makes individual Bombers limited in effectiveness, but when used en masse they can be shockingly efficient. To respond to the growing threat from smaller craft, Destroyers have been retooled to include weapons designed to protect themselves and other ships from these versatile spacecraft. 
UNIT_NUCLEAR_MISSILE_PEDIA = The so-called "Doomsday Missile" is the culmination of the Missile's development. When technologies were developed which allowed the use of Anti-Ship Missiles in space combat, it was not long before innovative nuclear versions entered into production. Containing even thicker armor, more powerful shields and the fastest rocket engines available, everything about this weapon is designed to ensure the warhead reaches its target and, once there, unleashes lethal damage. While extremely effective, the cost of the payload coupled with the systems required to ensure its proper delivery makes these weapons also extremely expensive.
UNIT_GUIDED_MISSILE_PEDIA = While Missiles had been in use for hundreds - if not thousands - of years in terrestrial warfare, they were ineffective in space combat until new technological developments could occur. While Missiles could deliver devastating payloads, even nuclear warheads, to an enemy vessel or Star System, their slow speed and light armor made them far too vulnerable to defensive laser fire. To counter this, new versions were fitted with heavier armor and an energy shield designed to withstand fire from the small laser weapons which could be aimed fast enough to destroy them. These upgrades proved quite effective, as larger beam weapons required too much time for the targeting computers to achieve a lock and fire an accurate shot, and once again Missiles became a major force in combat. Soon the Cruiser class vessels were developed to serve as platforms to transport and fire them, extending the Anti-Ship Missile's range beyond static planets and Starbases.
UNIT_SCOUT_PEDIA = The Scout Ship is designed to explore the unknown quadrants of the universe and unlock their secrets. Craft of this type were the first human ships to be sent into space, and early versions were typically unmanned and very primitive. However, as technology improved the purpose of Scout ships expanded to include a military function, serving as the eyes and ears of the fleet. With more powerful engines and advanced sensors, Scouts could perform the vital task of both exploration and intelligence-gathering. While the sight and speed of these ships is impressive, their weaponry remains distinctly sub-par, and Scouts should never be relied upon in a battle of any significance.
UNIT_STEALTH_SHIP_PEDIA = When the human Colonies began to come into contact with one another competition immediately erupted. Eager to find a way to undermine its opponents, each Colony began searching for new technologies to weaken them. One such way was through sabotage and intelligence-gathering. However, advanced sensors and detection systems made such activities difficult to perform. The Stealth Ship was the response to this. Designed to elude detection, they employ sophisticated synthetic materials and polymers to 'trick' enemies into thinking the ship is a rock or piece of debris. Having escaped discovery, they are then able to perform their missions.
UNIT_BATTLESHIP_PEDIA = The Battleship is the end result of the yearning for ultimate power in the universe. The last of the 'direct contact' warships to be developed, the Battleship is the pinnacle of destructive power. Mounted in a number of immense turrets, its weaponry is capable of vaporizing any weaker vessel. This might comes at a steep price, however: in addition to being incredibly expensive, battleships are also slow and vulnerable to longer-range indirect attacks from enemy Missiles and Bombers, which means that a Battleship must be protected from these assaults by a fleet of lesser Cruisers and Destroyers. The Battleship's cost and weaknesses often cause civilizations to shirk their use in favor of more practical ship types. However, if the Battleship's vulnerabilities can be protected, it can unleash unparalleled destruction upon any foe.
UNIT_CARRIER_PEDIA = As weapons became smaller and more powerful, Bomber Squadrons became real threats to larger ships. However, with their limited range, the need arose for a ship able to extend this destructive capability across the universe, and the Carrier was the result. This ship is potentially the most deadly ship in the universe. The Carrier itself is relatively weak, and only possesses minimal defenses against other ships. The true power of the Carrier lies within its cargo hold, as a small hive of Fighter and Bomber Squadrons wait patiently to overwhelm unsuspecting foes. This allows the Carrier to project its power beyond the reach of any other ship. The best way to destroy a Carrier is to get within range to attack the ship directly and to overwhelm it, or to destroy its complement of strike craft, leaving it defenseless. However, with its defenses intact and supported by other vessels, the Carrier can be a frightening enemy.
UNIT_STARBASE_PEDIA = The Starbase is more like a miniature Star System than a vessel. It possesses great firepower and defenses, but remains a static platform once built, and as such can be vulnerable to attack from more mobile opponents. The Starbase's indirect attack capability is impressive - the base is equipped with a powerful main cannon, automatically manufactures Missiles and is able to serve as a base for Fighter and Bomber Squadrons. Additionally, the Starbase heals units and has a formidable visibility range. To destroy a Starbase requires isolating it from any fleet which might assist in its defense.
UNIT_ADVOCATE_PEDIA = With mankind venturing into space for the first time, new questions arose for humanity to answer. What is the meaning of our existence, why are we entering this new realm? Advocates were the men with the answers. The Advocates of Power, Wealth, Survival, Knowledge and Religion all seek to spread the word of their faith and bring believers to their cause in hopes of bringing enlightenment to all of man's scattered nations.
UNIT_COLONY_SHIP_STRATEGY = Unable to attack or defend, Colony Ships are the units which Colonize Star Systems and extend your control over the universe.
UNIT_CONSTRUCT_SHIP_STRATEGY = The Construction Ship is used to build Warp and Jump Lanes to speed movement and the Extraction Facility to harvest resources. It is also necessary in order to create the powerful Starbase unit.
UNIT_PLANETARY_DEFENSE_STRATEGY = Planetary Defense Ships are units specialized to defend Star Systems from enemy attacks.
UNIT_INVASION_SHIP_STRATEGY = Invasion Ships are units designed to capture enemy Star Systems, but are slow and weak in other battles.
UNIT_SPACE_FIGHTER_STRATEGY = Fighter Squadrons are designed to protect Star Systems and ships from attacking Bomber Squadrons, and also to defeat enemy Fighter Squadrons.
UNIT_SPACE_BOMBER_STRATEGY = The Bomber Squadron is a unit which is effective against most ship types, but is vulnerable to Destroyers and Fighter Squadrons.
UNIT_NUCLEAR_MISSILE_STRATEGY = Doomsday Missiles are similar to regular Missiles, except once reaching their target they unleash nuclear devastation upon it.
UNIT_SCOUT_STRATEGY = The Scout is useful for both exploring the map and using its speed and visibility range to find the locations of enemy forces.
UNIT_STEALTH_SHIP_STRATEGY = The Stealth Ship is invisible to all other types of starship except other Stealth Ships. They are required to perform Espionage Missions.
UNIT_BATTLESHIP_STRATEGY = The Battleship is the single most powerful ship in the game, but is slow and can be countered with Missiles and Bombers.
UNIT_CARRIER_STRATEGY = The Carrier is an expensive ship whose purpose is to hold Fighter and Bomber Squadrons, but its direct combat capabilities are highly limited.
UNIT_STARBASE_STRATEGY = The Starbase is a powerful immobile platform which can use indirect fire on passing starships, manufactures Missiles, can base Fighters and Bombers, heals units and extends a civilization's cultural influence.
UNIT_ADVOCATE_STRATEGY = The Advocate can spread the Value of which it belongs to a Star System where such Values don't yet exist.

#################### Building Pedia & Strategy ####################
BUILDING_CAPITOL_PEDIA = The axis around which a galactic principality turns, Capitols act as the administrative center for a government. Often Capitols become the shining stars of galactic settlements, with resources from all ends of the universe making their way to Capitol planets, either for the benefit of local industries or to help line the pockets of local politicians. The first Colonial Capitols were established in 2302 AD, when contact with the Earth and the ruling PDE was lost.
BUILDING_NUTRITION_FACILITY_PEDIA = The development of advanced hydroponics remains one of the most crucial discoveries in the expansion of interstellar settlement. The oxygen produced by photosynthetic life nurtured through hydroponic systems has been used to sustain settlers and even terraform alien atmospheres. Such facilities have become the backbone of sustaining human life on new worlds.
BUILDING_MINING_FACILITY_PEDIA = Core Drillers - massive mining systems designed to extract the valuable materials often located within a planet's liquid center - were once considered the most efficient method of mineral extraction possible. Yet, with the collapse of several cored planets and the resulting losses of capital - not to mention life -   Core Drillers have on the whole been abandoned for more traditional methods. Conventional mining systems, marked by their Space Elevator transports, have returned from the edge of obsolescence to become once again the most reliable way to increase a planet's production capabilities.
BUILDING_MAG_LEV_NETWORK_PEDIA = In the early twentieth century, a scientist named Walther Meissner noted that certain superconductive materials tended to give off a very small, but exceedingly powerful magnetic field. His discovery remains the basis for all modern Magnetic Levitation transportation. The PMX-04 Mag-Lev Engine continues to hold the record for fastest land speed vehicle in history, clocking in at over 15,000 kilometers per hour. Planets which have invested in Mag-Lev transportation have found their efficiency - and thus wealth - skyrocketing. Cheap and effective, Mag-Lev technology is used in the transport of goods and people, greasing the wheels of the planetary economy.
BUILDING_COMMERCIAL_SATELLITES_PEDIA = Commercial Satellites are one of the most cost-effective ways for a planet to increase its income. With the sudden rise in demand for ultra-fast planet-based communication, enterprising Systems with the means to invest in Commercial Satellites have found they can charge near-extortion level fees to help redirect various radio, visual and infrared signals to their proper destination. To boot, these satellites can be used to monitor their relayed signals, providing news and information, helping to spread recognized cultural achievements throughout the Star System.
BUILDING_HABITATION_SYSTEM_PEDIA = One needs only look to history's premier metropolis of Philadelphia to see the wonders of a well-designed Habitation System. A perfected recycling system, employing a series of genetically modified E. coli bacteria to consume organic material, blends seamlessly into the city's surrounding countryside, purifying waste water to allow reuse, so all that drains into nearby Delaware Bay is a trickle of water. By harnessing this technology, blossoming Colonies can quickly turn man's most abundant resource, his waste, into usable sources of water, allowing such Colonies to outgrow their less efficient neighbors. In combination with new controlled-environment technology, the supportable population of a region is greatly increased through the use of such systems.
BUILDING_TRAINING_COMPOUND_PEDIA = Much of military training is based on intricate processes of muscle memory, developed by performing the same actions in a repeated manner until almost no input from the nervous system is required. "Instinct," "Empty Mind," "No-Brainer," the technique has many names, but all once depended on an extremely strict, extremely lengthy training regimen. And while strict discipline is still required to keep cadets sharp and under control, special "Training Compounds" injected directly into the soldiers' muscles can now mimic trained muscle memory  with an almost eighty percent success rate. In effect, troops can now receive battle experience without ever leaving their base. The result is noticeably fiercer, more reliable soldiers.
BUILDING_CAPITAL_SHIPYARD_PEDIA = While smaller ships can be built planetside and launched from the ground, larger vessels such as Carriers, Battleships and Cruisers require an above-atmosphere Shipyard to allow for proper construction. The original off-world Shipyard was essentially a glorified space elevator, shifting goods and laborers to work on the space-moored starships. Today's Capital Shipyards much more closely mimic the military ports of the seventeenth century, with entire economies blossoming to create and maintain the Capital Ships of a Star System's fleet.
BUILDING_SQUADRON_FACTORY_PEDIA = Squadron Factories allow the construction of single or small-crewed vessels such as Fighters and Bombers. As these vessels have become more important in space combat, Squadron Factories have become increasingly necessary in Star Systems throughout the universe. Although construction processes may vary from Star System to Star System, all Squadron Factories have the same goal - produce Fighter and Bomber Squadrons in overwhelming numbers.
BUILDING_RECYCLING_CENTER_PEDIA = Remanufacturing organic materials, which have only four or five major elements, is child's play in comparison to the complicated recycling of industrial and commercial materials. The only machine yet built that can handle such a wide array of elemental compounds is the aptly-named Universal Recycler. Part supercomputer, part organic digester, the Universal Recycler, developed by the MaKGarry Corporation, uses a complex series of algorithms to determine a material's makeup and most effective recycling method. While suspicious environmentalists have claimed that when a material fails to match any of the prescribed recycling methods the machine simply opens a minor black hole to dispose of the offending object, posing great risk to the entire planetary Star System, Company spokesmen rigorously deny such accusations. Regardless, waste that enters the Recycler will never affect the health of humanity ever again.
BUILDING_SPORTS_ARENA_PEDIA = Throughout human history, few things have remained as consistently popular as sports, and few experiences as rewarding as the well-earned victory of one's favorite athletic organization. Planet to planet, sports vary due to landscape and available gravity, but the excitement of watching the best of the best compete in their national sports remains one of the few universal pleasures enjoyed by all modern men and women.
BUILDING_INTERPLANETARY_BEACON_PEDIA = While pirating commercial signals can help provide a Star System with a base sense of universal culture, the enlightening pulse of an Interplanetary Beacon remains the only way to tap into the cultural mainstream. Broadcasting visual, auditory and telecommunications signals, Interplanetary Beacons allow near instant interaction between people anywhere in a Star System. Any Planet which wants to be taken seriously among its peers must have an Interplanetary Beacon.
BUILDING_UNIVERSITY_PEDIA = While the past centuries have provided many developments making human survival more likely, education remains vital to a civilization's future growth and advancement. In a highly-competitive, ever-more-complex universe, Universities are critical components in the advanced education required to deal with the increasing complexity of human life. While not designed to specialize to the same degree as Research Labs, Universities are the cornerstones of higher education and research in Star Systems throughout the universe.
BUILDING_RESEARCH_LAB_PEDIA = Freed from the daily rigors of academia, scientists affiliated with Research Labs are at the forefront of modern research and development. Whether funded by private industry or public coffers, Research Labs have been responsible for many of history's most influential discoveries. Any Star System that funds a Research Lab is certain to reap great rewards from the investment. 
BUILDING_BANKING_SYSTEM_PEDIA = No Star System worth its weight in silicon can ignore the need for a centralized Banking System. Allowing both laborers and entrepreneurs to borrow wealth in order to invest in the future, modern banks continue their long history of spreading prosperity - for some - wherever they go.
BUILDING_SPACEPORT_PEDIA = While a standard bank gives the laborer or businessman a place to invest their hard-earned wages, a Spaceport gives an entire planet a way to effectively manage its wealth. Guiding the ebb and flow of trade and transportation for their planets, the sheer amounts of commerce generated by these institutions can shape worlds.
BUILDING_FACTORY_PEDIA = Factories are good at one thing and one thing only - production. Often dirty and dangerous, the sole concern of the factory is output. How much can be created in the least amount of time possible? Any factory worker can tell you the correct response is always "more, more, more." Factories will increase production in any Star System in which they are built.
BUILDING_MANUFACTURING_PLANT_PEDIA = Industrial efficiency is a critical component in a Star System's success or failure. Waste, whether in the form of unnecessary labor, harsh pollutants or errors in production can cost a Star System dearly. Manufacturing Plants do away with the inefficiencies of factories. A combined production facility, recycling plant and residency, the Manufacturing Plant can reach a level of production no simple factory could ever hope to achieve.
BUILDING_STARDOCK_PEDIA = While Capital Shipyards are always highly militarized institutions, Stardocks are much more lax establishments. Open to buyers and sellers from across the universe, Stardocks have become the bazaars of the modern era. Traveling merchants may, for a small fee, dock and open shop within a Stardock, allowing the natives to peruse their offworld wares, purchasing them in exchange for local resources. Although the growing Merchant Guilds seek to monopolize trade among the Star Systems, Stardocks can still greatly increase a system's profits from the routes it possesses. 
BUILDING_POLICE_AGENCY_PEDIA = The sheer vastness of space makes ensuring law and order a difficult task for modern Police Agencies. Often relying on more "active" policing techniques than their predecessors, Police Agencies maintain heavy surveillance on known criminals, malcontents and ne'er-do-wells, seeking to disrupt their activities before they ever pose a threat to society. These Police Agencies for a new age promote the idea that staying quiet and unnoticed is never a bad thing. As such, War Weariness and Star System Maintenance costs are reduced with an Agency's construction, while Espionage output rises.
BUILDING_INTELLIGENCE_CENTER_PEDIA = While abstract knowledge remains the domain of the Research Lab, political and military information has its own master - the Intelligence Center. Charged with keeping tabs on friends and foes alike, Intelligence Centers meld the unending persistence of machine with the wily nature of man to create an organization capable of digging out nearly anything that can be known about anyone. Used as often for protection as for destruction, Intelligence Centers both increase the difficulty for an enemy to engage in Espionage and the ease at which their owners can do the same. 
BUILDING_AIR_DEFENSE_NETWORK_PEDIA = In the eternal vastness of space, a single Missile or lone Bomber can be as difficult to spot as a needle in a lightless haystack. Probing the skies with an ever-watchful digital eye, the Squadron Defense Network is a Star System's most reliable defense against surprise attack. A highly sophisticated network of system-wide sensors monitored by highly-sophisticated computers, the Squadron Defense Network is able to track thousands of targets and assess their threat level on the fly. Yet the sheer amount of traffic on even a mid-sized shipping world makes the Squadron Defense Network a less than perfect aegis against incoming threats.
BUILDING_STAR_FORTRESS_PEDIA = Astro-synchronous combat is often an extremely complicated affair, with defending ships having to fight both the barrages of their enemies and the orbital pull of their home planets. Star Fortresses, a long series of docking bays, sensors and armaments in orbit around a Star System, provide a continual buttress against enemy onslaughts.
BUILDING_CAPITOL_STRATEGY = The Capitol is the Building which determines the location of your civilization's Capital.
BUILDING_NUTRITION_FACILITY_STRATEGY = The Nutrition Facility increases [ICON_FOOD] output when the Star System has population assigned to the Planet it's built upon.
BUILDING_MINING_FACILITY_STRATEGY = The Mining Facility increases [ICON_PRODUCTION] output when the Star System has population assigned to the Planet it's built upon.
BUILDING_MAG_LEV_NETWORK_STRATEGY = The Mag Lev Network increases [ICON_COMMERCE] output when the Star System has population assigned to the Planet it's built upon.
BUILDING_COMMERCIAL_SATELLITES_STRATEGY = Building Commercial Satellites increases [ICON_COMMERCE] output when the Star System has population assigned to the Planet it's built upon, while also providing a small amount of [ICON_CULTURE].
BUILDING_HABITATION_SYSTEM_STRATEGY = The Habitation System increases the Population limit of the planet it's built on, which is vital for long-term growth.
BUILDING_TRAINING_COMPOUND_STRATEGY = Training Compounds provide all military units constructed in this Star System with additional Prestige.
BUILDING_CAPITAL_SHIPYARD_STRATEGY = A Capital Shipyard allows the construction of Carriers, Battleships and Cruisers, making it vital to a Civilization wanting to build the most powerful starships.
BUILDING_SQUADRON_FACTORY_STRATEGY = A Squadron Factory allows the construction of Fighter and Bomber Squadrons, allowing for indirect ranged strikes and protection from them.
BUILDING_RECYCLING_CENTER_STRATEGY = A Recycling Center raises the level of [ICON_HEALTHY] in the Star System, increasing the population it can support.
BUILDING_SPORTS_ARENA_STRATEGY = A Sports Arena raises the level of [ICON_HAPPY] in the Star System, increasing the population it can support.
BUILDING_INTERPLANETARY_BEACON_STRATEGY = The Interplanetary Beacon greatly increases the [ICON_CULTURE] generated by this Star System, which increases border size and defensive bonuses.
BUILDING_UNIVERSITY_STRATEGY = The University increases [ICON_RESEARCH] output, allowing technologies to be researched faster, particularly when built in Star Systems with large amounts of Commerce.
BUILDING_RESEARCH_LAB_STRATEGY = The Research Lab increases [ICON_RESEARCH] output, allowing technologies to be researched faster, although it requires a University already be built on the Planet.
BUILDING_BANKING_SYSTEM_STRATEGY = The Banking System increases [ICON_COMMERCE] output, providing more money for the treasury when Commerce %% is allocated to Gold.
BUILDING_SPACEPORT_STRATEGY = The Spaceport increases [ICON_COMMERCE] output, providing more money for the treasury when Commerce %% is allocated to Gold, although it requires a Banking System already be built on the Planet.
BUILDING_FACTORY_STRATEGY = The Factory increases [ICON_PRODUCTION] output in this Star System, allowing it to complete construction projects more quickly, but at the cost of Star System health.
BUILDING_MANUFACTURING_PLANT_STRATEGY = The Manufacturing Plant increases [ICON_PRODUCTION] output in this Star System, allowing it to complete construction more quickly. It requires that a Factory already be built on the Planet.
BUILDING_STARDOCK_STRATEGY = The Stardock increases [ICON_COMMERCE] from Trade Routes, providing a greater benefit to Star Systems which have many such routes.
BUILDING_POLICE_AGENCY_STRATEGY = The Police Agency serves many roles, reducing War Weariness, decreasing Maintenance and increasing [ICON_ESPIONAGE] output, making it a good choice for large or aggressive Civilizations.
BUILDING_INTELLIGENCE_CENTER_STRATEGY = The Intelligence Center is a building suited for those who engage in Espionage, providing [ICON_ESPIONAGE] and also increasing its output from a Star System, while also providing defense against Missions used against this Star System.
BUILDING_AIR_DEFENSE_NETWORK_STRATEGY = The Squadron Defense Network reduces damage to Units inside a Star System from Squadron and Nuclear attacks.
BUILDING_STAR_FORTRESS_STRATEGY = The Star Fortress increases the strength of starships when defending inside this Star System, making the Star System harder to capture.
#################### Civics Pedia & Strategy ####################
CIVIC_TRADITIONAL_MILITARY_PEDIA = The Traditionalist Military does not specialize in any specific type of production or doctrine, meaning that they incur none of the heavy costs associated with a specialized Military policy, but also reap none of its benefits. 
CIVIC_PACIFISM_PEDIA = Drawing their teachings from ancient twentieth-century philosophers such as Mohandas Gandhi and Martin Luther King the Second, Pacifist principalities have effectively cut the military from their industrial complexes, making for sleeker and more agile economies. As a result, these nations are able to produce consumer and industrial goods at a far greater pace than their bellicose brethren, but lack the infrastructure to properly support military starships, incurring added costs for those which are constructed.
CIVIC_LIGHT_SHIP_DOCTRINE_PEDIA = As the most versatile of military policies, the "Light Ship" doctrine has become the perfect balance point for nations looking to have a diversified military. Not requiring a massive infrastructure commitment, a well-balanced fleet of Light Ships including Cruisers, Destroyers, Invasion Ships and Planetary Defenders can hold their own against most any other fleet in the universe. Unless, of course, they run afoul of a fleet of well-protected Battleships.
CIVIC_CAPITAL_SHIP_DOCTRINE_PEDIA = The space-age equivalent of invading Russia in the winter, the construction of a successful Battleship fleet can easily end in folly for any principality that might dare to attempt it. The Capital Ship Doctrine requires an all-out commitment from those in power, with a fair share of a principality's military minds dedicating themselves solely to the support of such a fleet of behemoths. Luckily, once the mid-space riggings are constructed and the necessary industries assembled, Battleship construction quickly becomes a surprisingly reasonable effort at a significantly reduced cost.
CIVIC_SQUADRON_DOCTRINE_PEDIA = Deadly, mobile and overwhelming. This is the motto of the adherents of the Squadron Doctrine. Being assigned to a Carrier fleet was once considered a demotion, but today, thanks to advances in Bomber and Fighter technologies, Carrier commanders have become the rising stars of the Colonies' militaries. Using coordinated mob tactics, a fully-armed Carrier can overcome even the mighty Battleship. Yet due to the numerous and varied types of ships involved, the preparation of a Carrier fleet requires a significant commitment of resources. Dedicating one's military policy specifically to the development of Carrier fleets, though, can sharply reduce these overall costs.
CIVIC_FRONTIER_PEDIA = Known also as "adhocracies", Frontier Governments tend to be rushed affairs, with new services and branches added as necessary, without any specified ideology to guide them. They suffer none of the penalties of other, more ideologically-driven governments, but receive none of the benefits. They are typically a stopgap measure undertaken prior to adopting a more stable and effective government.
CIVIC_MONARCHY_PEDIA = Giving a nod from the absolutist rulers of the seventeenth century, the Monarchy Government Policy establishes a hereditary lineage to rule your principality. This centralized power structure allows for a much more direct means to command an empire. Because Monarchies focus all power into a single household, the capital cities of these governments often blossom into centers of commerce and production, as resources from across the breadth of the universe rush to fulfill the whims of the royal family. 
CIVIC_DEMOCRACY_PEDIA = Taking a page from the book of populist rulers of the late twentieth-century, the Democracy Government Policy sets up a civic society in which all members of society - theoretically - have the opportunity to participate and contribute. Corruption often devalued the democratic traditions of the past, but with advances in intra-human networking and power projection, when the ruling body is dedicated to providing it, universal participation has become the rule rather than the exception. The resulting situation fosters an overwhelming sense of contentment throughout the populous. 
CIVIC_TECHNOCRACY_PEDIA = Taking the policies set forth in the mid-twenty-second century by the Initiative to Advance Scientific Research (IASR), the Technocracy places the guidance of the people within the hands of the educated. And while the original IASR was only concerned with technology capable of restoring Earth to its former glory, modern Technocracies are massive research-governed societies meshed with industrial complexes developed enough to implement their discoveries. The adoption of a Technocratic Government Policy will ensure an immediate increase in research in all tiers of society.
CIVIC_POLICE_STATE_PEDIA = The Police State is a time-honored tradition among paranoid dictators and god-complex-carrying father states. The phrase "status quo" takes on a holy meaning in the Police State, as all dissent is crushed by the principality's enormous secret police apparatus. As a result, War Weariness is greatly reduced by forcing the populace to remain quiet with the butt of a weapon. This same intricate and well-funded body of informants and undercover officers grants Police State leaders an impressive knowledge of their foes and allies. And to keep their trigger-happy commandants' personnel rosters full, Police States compliment their shadow army with an impressive military complex, churning out military production at a rate few other principalities can hope to match.
CIVIC_DEFAULT_LABOR_PEDIA = The Classical or Free Market Labor Force is an application of the ancient policies of theorist Adam Smith. While allowing employers to select their employees and employees to solicit a number of employers for positions was once considered acceptable labor practice, most advanced principalities have now done away with the process and its inherent inefficiencies and waste. Free from all government interference, the Classical Labor force carries with it neither bonuses nor penalties.
CIVIC_MECHANIZED_WORKFORCE_PEDIA = Extremely popular in Technocracies or principalities with low populations, the modern mechanized workforce can trace its routes all the way back to the original industrial robots employed as painters or welders in the mass production facilities of yesteryear. Due to the limited technical knowledge of their creators, ancient industrial robots were capable of little beyond the most repetitive of jobs.\n\nIn contrast, modern mechanized "Guild" systems employ a throng of general purpose "Novice" bots to ready the raw materials for the highly specialized "Master" machines with sophisticated AI routines, which have been known to enter flurries of creative and innovative development that could rival the greatest human craftsmen of the past. The efficiency of this system increases production significantly wherever it is adopted, but tends to draw resentment from human society's less mechanically inclined. 
CIVIC_SLAVE_STATE_PEDIA = Slaves have had many names over the breadth of human history - indentured servant, plantation worker, fast-food employee - but the resulting system has remained essentially the same: when one portion of society works solely for the benefit of another, slavery is at hand. With a complete lack of human rights, Slave States are able to push their workers at a (literally) breakneck pace, resulting in the speedy completion of the project at the cost of human lives. The philosophy of the slave state dictates that some people are expendable for the greater good, and you might very well be one of those people.
CIVIC_UTOPIA_PEDIA = Before the rise of Utilitarianism, the galactic labor market was often a bleak place. Men and women were forced to perform unending hours of backbreaking labor in order to compete with the tireless machines that had now become so prevalent. It would take the actions of a single hammer-bearer at a stone mile marker facility, Easla Ve, to finally bring about a change for the average human worker. Tired of endlessly "crunching" for milestones with little chance to develop a life for herself, Ve struck out for infinity with a small enclave of her fellow "Crunchers."\n\nHoping to build a society where human life was more important than output, Ve created the first Utopian Labor system, allowing workers to take their time and make certain that their lives outside their work was not neglected. This small, nurturing society eventually spun into a galaxy-wide movement, unconcerned with the never-ending rigors of commerce and production.
CIVIC_SIMPLE_ECONOMY_PEDIA = Originally found in the some of the backwater Colonial Star Systems of the universe, the guideless Free Market, or Simple, economy relies on the hodge-podge interplay between sellers and buyers with absolutely no guidance from governing bodies. Relying solely on human charisma and guile rather than mechanized economic models, simple economies receive none of the benefits of their more organized associates, but also receive none of the penalties.
CIVIC_INDUSTRIALISM_PEDIA = Industrialism, raising its sooty head in the manufacturing cities of eighteenth-century England, continued to be the driving force of progress throughout the next three hundred years. Relying on rapid and repetitive production, with little concern for much beyond their quotas, Industrial Economies remain some of the most productive in human history. Yet the incalculable amount of waste created by these economies remains one of the key causes of the deterioration of Earth's ecosystem and the initiation of the human flight into space. Industrialism would see a revival when Colonies were founded on new, unspoiled Star Systems. The desire to produce "more, faster" would once again become the ultimate priority for governments desperate to gain any edge.
CIVIC_GREEN_ECONOMY_PEDIA = The early twenty-first century saw the rise of the sustainability, or "Green," movement, among Earth's economic powers. Beginning more as a self-defense mechanism against overwhelming pollution rather  than as an earnest concern for the environment, the Green Economic Movement insinuated itself through much of human society, allowing for the careful management of resources in accordance with human need. Following the great wars of the late 21st century and the massive destruction they unleashed upon the Earth, a genuine desire to clean up the environment emerged. But to this day with Man spread across the universe, resistant forces among the economically-minded decry the Green Movement for its lack of consideration for industry, as the costs of restrictive measures to keep human waste in check undeniably reduces the ability of such societies to compete with their opponents in industry and war.
CIVIC_PLANNED_ECONOMY_PEDIA = Modern Planned Economies rely almost exclusively on the research of a single man - Dr. Edward E. Piper. Piper's creation of visionary economic simulators remains unparalleled to this day, and his centralized system of inputs allowed for two or three highly-trained theorists to create an economic model for an entire interstellar empire, greatly reducing the costs usually associated with maintaining an entire bureaucratic planning system. But because of the static nature of Piper's system, the radical theorist passing away in the late twenty-second century, production levels will never be able to reach heights equal to those of more modern systems.
CIVIC_TRADITIONAL_MILITARY_STRATEGY = Traditional is the default Military Policy, providing no bonuses or penalties of any type.
CIVIC_PACIFISM_STRATEGY = Pacifism provides a bonus of [ICON_PRODUCTION] in every Star System in exchange for increasing the upkeep cost of units. This makes it a good option for those with a small military but not for those who plan on being involved in many wars.
CIVIC_LIGHT_SHIP_DOCTRINE_STRATEGY = Light Ship Doctrine allows the faster construction of Cruisers, Destroyers, Invasion Ships and Planetary Defense Ships. It is ideal for players who prefer smaller starships and avoid using the more expensive Battleships and Carriers.
CIVIC_CAPITAL_SHIP_DOCTRINE_STRATEGY = Capital Ship Doctrine allows the faster construction of Battleships. Vital for those who prefer using these powerful units, it reduces their prohibitively-expensive cost to something more reasonable.
CIVIC_SQUADRON_DOCTRINE_STRATEGY = Squadron Doctrine allows the faster construction of Carriers, Bombers and Fighters. Players which like the powerful capabilities of indirect attack can use this Policy to increase the size of their forces.
CIVIC_FRONTIER_STRATEGY = Frontier is the default Government Policy, providing no bonuses or penalties of any type.
CIVIC_MONARCHY_STRATEGY = Monarchy increases [ICON_PRODUCTION] and [ICON_COMMERCE] in the capital, making it useful for small Civilizations or ones with an already large and productive capital Star System.
CIVIC_DEMOCRACY_STRATEGY = Democracy provides additional [ICON_HAPPY] in the largest cities, increasing the maximum population an empire can become.
CIVIC_TECHNOCRACY_STRATEGY = The Technocracy focuses on Research, increasing [ICON_RESEARCH] throughout the Civilization.
CIVIC_POLICE_STATE_STRATEGY = Police State is well-suited for players who fight many wars, increasing Military production, Espionage and reducing War Weariness
CIVIC_DEFAULT_LABOR_STRATEGY = Classical Labor Force is the default Labor Policy, providing no bonuses or penalties of any type.
CIVIC_MECHANIZED_WORKFORCE_STRATEGY = Mechanized Workforce increases [ICON_PRODUCTION] in all Star Systems, but at the cost of adding [ICON_UNHAPPY] as well.
CIVIC_SLAVE_STATE_STRATEGY = Slave State permits a Civilization to rush production in Star Systems, sacrificing population to do so, while also allowing the conscription of units.
CIVIC_UTOPIA_STRATEGY = Utopia increases the amount of [ICON_FOOD] produced by every planet, but at the cost of reducing both [ICON_PRODUCTION] and [ICON_COMMERCE].
CIVIC_SIMPLE_ECONOMY_STRATEGY = Simple Economy is the default Economy Policy, providing no bonuses or penalties of any type.
CIVIC_INDUSTRIALISM_STRATEGY = Industrialism increases [ICON_PRODUCTION] in all Star Systems but increases [ICON_UNHEALTHY], limiting maximum population.
CIVIC_GREEN_ECONOMY_STRATEGY = Green raises the Population Limit on all Planets, allowing for a higher population and more customization, but [ICON_COMMERCE] will suffer noticeably as a result.
CIVIC_PLANNED_ECONOMY_STRATEGY = Planned removes Maintenance costs from all Star Systems, making it ideal for widespread empires, but [ICON_PRODUCTION] is reduced as a result.

#################### Religions Pedia Entries ####################
VALUE_KNOWLEDGE_PEDIA = The driving force of human civilization, a dedication to Knowledge has always been a key characteristic of history's greatest nations. The librarian, teacher and scientist reign in civilizations dedicated to knowledge, and their influences spur such nations to great heights of research and understanding. From the libraries of Alexandria to the Encyclopediae Galactica of today, Knowledge remains man's greatest tie to his past and the most certain way to assure his future. 
VALUE_POWER_PEDIA = Assuring the reign of the strong over the weak, a dedication to Power has always been a requisite characteristic of history's greatest nations. Civilizations dedicated to power need not be warlike. Rather, such civilizations revolve around the idea that those that can do, must do. Ability is of top concern and acting on such abilities a civic duty. A dedication to Power ensures that strength - of body, mind or heart - will reign and will force the next generation to move forward by any means necessary.
VALUE_RELIGION_PEDIA = While power, knowledge and wealth may tempt those of more mundane spirits, a dedication to Religion has always been a distinguishing characteristic of history's greatest nations. Belief in something greater, something that transcends mortal man's petty squabbles, has driven civilizations throughout human history to the greatest of successes. Would Gandhi or Muhammad remain familiar names even in the twenty-fourth century, if not for their fervent dedication to their beliefs? A dedication to Religion grants a people a common soul, one that will keep them rising towards what only the heavens may prescribe.
VALUE_SURVIVAL_PEDIA = How can one be expected to dedicate themselves to wealth with thieves at their doorstep? How can one dedicate himself to knowledge if they are unable to hear their own thoughts over a growling stomach? Who can dedicate themselves to power when they are too weak to stand? How can one dedicate themselves to otherworldly religions when people in this world starve? A dedication to Survival ensures that no such needs ever go unfulfilled.
VALUE_WEALTH_PEDIA = A dedication to wealth adds value to life. Capitalist, communist, free market or fixed, the method doesn't matter, so long as growth is continual and prosperity ensured. Those with wealth understand the true pressures of the modern world and how, with a little smart thinking and persistence, such pressures can always be overcome. With benefits.
#################### Tech Pedia Entries ####################
TECH_MILITARY_0_PEDIA = One of the most important steps in the advancement of modern warfare has been the development of gravity training facilities. The first interplanetary invasions of rebellious colonies, initiated by the PDE, were terribly botched affairs, with the majority of the invading force fainting as they hit 4 times the Earth's gravity upon entering the enemy atmosphere. With the development of Gravity Training, disseminated through Training Compounds, soldiers could now endure the gravitational forces generated by craft entering a planet's atmosphere. These developments also prompted the creation of the first dedicated Invasion Ships that made global invasions much more effective than in the past.
TECH_MILITARY_1_PEDIA = While West Point and Saint-Cyr may have been fine training grounds for the land-based battles of Earth's wars, three-dimensional, zero-gravity combat contained sufficient subtleties to warrant its own institution. The People's Academy, the Earth's first institution dedicated to the study of interplanetary warfare, became widely renowned for its numerous innovations and the cutthroat quality of its graduates. It was discoveries made by Academy graduates that led to the construction of the first Capital Ship, the PDES Destroyer Charles Vincent. Graduates from the school would spread across the planet, taking with them the teachings of the People's Academy, and sowing the first seeds of their martial tradition.
TECH_MILITARY_2_PEDIA = Manufacturing spacebound vessels requires a level of precision previously unattainable in Earth's mass production facilities. A single misplaced weld on an airlock could spell disaster for all those aboard a newly minted spacecraft, not to mention the reputation of the spacecraft's manufacturer. New production techniques, often known collectively as the Newcomb Method, properly balanced profits with precision, allowing the creation of humanity's first Capital Shipyards on the Earth. These facilities were in their infancy when the Colonies found themselves alone in 2302 AD, and the technology they required had to be rediscovered by the fledgling Colonial space empires. An unintended consequence of these new methods was a massive increase in industrial espionage, with hopes of stealing new methods of constructing and running these massive, expensive facilities. This development led to the widespread creation of Intelligence Centers to both acquire foreign trade secrets and combat the loss of domestic ones.
TECH_MILITARY_3_PEDIA = Newton's third law - for every action, there is an equal but opposite reaction - was of particular importance to military ship designers. Lighter ships, when struck by a projectile of any size, would often be set slightly off course, making accurate return fire impossible. This made early light ship battles beleaguered affairs, as each ship, tilting through the void, would fire wildly, hoping for even a grazing hit against foes countless kilometers away. The development of modern shields, which displace the shock of a beam strike around, rather than through, the craft, made research into light ships far more attractive. This in turn led to the development of the Alpha class Cruiser as an Anti-Ship Missile platform, coupled with more powerful beam weapons and heavier armor. It was hoped that the new Missile technology would counter the defensive edge provided by shields. The new doctrine greatly spread the belief in the importance of Power. This tradition was inherited by the Colonies when contact with the Earth was lost. With newly-found independence, the need for the development of space warfare techniques became apparent, and the philosophies pioneered on the Earth were quickly adopted.
TECH_MILITARY_4_PEDIA = One of the few techniques to remain in the military playbook over the last three centuries was that of "Shock and Awe." The fundamentals of Shock and Awe are simple: amass a large enough, fearsome enough force, and let the fear of imminent destruction conquer what guns never could. The failure of past methods to acquire gains in war and deal with domestic disturbances saw new innovations. With smaller, weaker starships unable to accomplish their missions, the universe saw the development of the most powerful starship ever seen - the Battleship. Meanwhile, governments began to turn to a more uncompromising stance on dissidence, becoming essentially a Police State, using Shock and Awe to restrain overly-excitable populaces.
TECH_MILITARY_5_PEDIA = With the growth in popularity of Shock and Awe techniques, a renewed interest in bigger and more impressive fleets swept the universe's militaries. The Capital Ship Doctrine became widely accepted practice for many military planners hoping to expand their Battleship contingent. These new developments also led to the refinement of the classic Invasion Ship, in hopes of tilting the balance of warfare even further towards the offensive. However, as the popularity of massive, powerful starships increased, a new group of pioneers began to study the use of the Carrier. Potentially capable of overwhelming the most powerful of Battleships, Carriers were designed to serve as mobile bases for the smaller, Squadron-based spacecraft which had seen an increase in usage.
TECH_MILITARY_6_PEDIA = With the development of the Carrier, a new surge of innovation swept the field of Squadron-based spacecraft deployment. The development of the Squadron Doctrine encouraged minor ships, for the first time in space combat history, to bear the brunt of combat. This renewal of Squadron combat made Destroyers once again an invaluable part of modern space combat. Δ class Destroyers were even more capable than their predecessors at plucking pesky Squadron spacecraft from the heavens.
TECH_MILITARY_7_PEDIA = The first intuitive computers (ICs) were designed by the "Initiative to Advance Scientific Research" (IASR) at the close of the twenty-second century as semi-intelligent industrial work machines. While the original IC schematics were lost with the apparent disappearance of Earth, new ICs have been constructed, their design gleaned from snippets of IASR research found in the data storage of various interplanetary beacons. In military applications, ICs, after comparing visible strategies to a comprehensive tactical database, could often begin predicting the movements of enemy ships, making a new generation of Missile-armed Cruisers the deadliest to ever ply the void. ICs also found wide use in domestic applications, with domineering states using the IC's long-range predicative technologies to quell rebellions years in advance. As a result, entire populations were enslaved so as to prevent future - predicted - uprisings. The accuracy of ICs was called into question by many officials, but they saw increasing use in subsequent years.
TECH_MILITARY_8_PEDIA = Advancements in predictive machinery greatly increased the feasible range of modern weaponry. To combat the growing rise in indirect Carrier-based warfare, extended-range Battleships took to the stars, giving the Capital ships a tactical advantage for the first time in many years. The application of intuitive computers to smaller arms had a significantly longer development time, but once sufficiently encapsulated intuitive computers were designed, new Invasion Ships quickly adopted the machines. And in the domestic realm, intuitive computers made the reasonable enforcement of law and order a job capable of being handled by a single agency, creating the first, truly effective IC-guided Policy Agencies in the universe.
TECH_MILITARY_9_PEDIA = The sheer precision of new intuitive battle computers made even the minutest flaws in a modern ship's armor a deadly weakness. If a piece of ordinance could slip through a vessel's shields, then that vessel's destruction was nearly assured. The remedy to such stunning offensive capabilities was the creation of the universe's first complete Alloy Frames, effectively a cocoon that surrounded the whole of the ship to decrease concussion damage and greatly limit the opportunities for ever-watching intuitive computers to inflict fatal damage. By adding this ultra-light weight, yet durable cocoon, larger and lighter Carriers and Destroyers could fair better against heavily-armed Capital ships.
TECH_MILITARY_10_PEDIA = The rapid military escalation of the past took a small hiatus with the discovery of Extended Range System algorithms, an offshoot of the intuitive computers that had pushed forward much of recent military innovation. Extended Range Systems made logical mid- to deep-future predictions with a near 75% accuracy. This meant that a missile could be fired with near pin-point precision before its target had even taken off from the landing pad, once again increasing the value of Cruisers. In the domestic sector, Extended Range Systems allowed the accurate use of previously indecipherable Piperian economic theorems, allowing Planned Economies to thrive at a level never before thought possible.
TECH_MILITARY_11_PEDIA = The mythic tale of T. J. Symonds and his theft of MaKGarry Corp's top-secret fusion cannon remains controversial to this day. Some see him as a psychotic warmonger, disseminating humanity's most dangerous weapon far and wide, while others see him as a space-age Robin Hood, spreading the knowledge of a machine that could allow the meek to stand up against the mighty. How he evaded the predictive powers of MaKGarry Corp's Extended Range System shall never be known, but thanks to Symonds, the first Ω class Battleships, the only vessel large enough to house the cannon, began rolling off the line throughout the universe.
TECH_MILITARY_12_PEDIA = The heightened conflict that arose from the dissemination of the Fusion Cannon schematics quickly swept the universe, leading to a level of warfare development heretofore not thought possible. As a new generation of Carriers made their way through the lightless battlefields of space in hopes of countering the mighty Ω class Battleship, the time for the ultimate conflict was at hand. Galactic Domination was man's only solution.
TECH_INDUSTRY_0_PEDIA = The impressive visual range of modern Scout ships is based almost completely on the development of unique Radar Polymers. In essence, these transform the entirety of the ship's hull into a hawk-eyed radar array. While this gave the Scout yet unmatched visual range, the need for an uninterrupted hull from which signals could be sent and received coupled with deep-space life support facilities and powerful engines meant the Scout could have little to no armaments and defenses.
TECH_INDUSTRY_1_PEDIA = While PDE scientist Jing Shen designed the first systems that would take humanity outside its solar system, it was the first Orbital Engineering Societies - organizations created in the Colonies following the fateful year of 2302 AD - that discovered methods to make exploring space a sustainable endeavor. The first Starbase, a massive space station capable of acting as a factory, barracks and hospital, was the direct creation of these early Orbital Engineers. New, space-guarded Anti-Ship Missiles likewise saw increased usage from this movement. Yet the most lasting effect of the rise of Orbital Engineering had to be the change in perspective of space, changing from an empty and hostile land to a world of endless opportunities.
TECH_INDUSTRY_2_PEDIA = Coupled with negative-energy fields, the Ion Engine was the culmination of the IASR's faster-than-light travel research. It was the impetus for the majority of early spacecraft innovations, although not necessarily in a logical way. Misfiring Ion Engines, while significantly more reliable than their fossil-fuel brethren, had been noted to occasionally erupt into massive balls of heat and plasma, destroying anything within a kilometer radius. Harnessing the destructive power of the ion, the first Bomber craft were constructed, with Squadron Factories following not long after to aid in the mass production of these powerful new weapons. To defend against these new craft, the first integrated Squadron Defense Networks were developed.
TECH_INDUSTRY_3_PEDIA = The discovery of Synthetic 10c, known colloquially as "The Emperor's Clothes" or "TEC," led to a great leap forward in space combat. This ultra-light and extremely durable synthetic material bore two invaluable features: the ability to reseal itself, slowly closing off air leaks in case of a breach, and, with the proper magnetic charge, the ability to reflect various forms of radiation, including light and infrared waves, in such a way that made its bearer nigh-invisible. The exorbitant cost of TEC made its application to ships rare, but the material's protective capabilities gave rise to the first successful Star Fortresses, which required a variety of advanced technologies to maintain optimum efficiency far from any Star System. The overwhelming demand for TEC, with entire Star Systems dedicating themselves to a cheaper method of manufacturing it, was one of the integral factors to the implementation of a new governmental system based on the principals of the IASR - the Technocracy.
TECH_INDUSTRY_4_PEDIA = As the space age grew from its infancy, infrastructure improvements led to the refinement of industrial Research and Development practices. The first to benefit from the increased research was the Scout Ship, which received a much needed update in the form of increased range and durability, incorporating the technologies developed since its initial manufacturing run. Developments in infrastructure likewise led to the support of massive planet-wide manufacturing facilities, Factories, which increased production wherever they were constructed.
TECH_INDUSTRY_5_PEDIA = Many of the rapid-fire discoveries brought about by the first Technocracies remained in use long after their development, but few can match the grandeur of the "Guild" Mechanized Workforce. The most important leap forward in robotics in many centuries, the Mechanized Workforce, with its general purpose "Novice" bots and specialized "Master" machines, were the first examples of semi-creative machinery using highly advanced AI routines. The Δ class Anti-Ship Missile was actually conceived, designed and manufactured by "Sophocles," the world's third mechanical Master craftsbot. These "Guild" Workforces excelled at even more mundane of tasks, and all contemporary Mining Facilities owe their success to the mechanical manpower of the indefatigable systems.
TECH_INDUSTRY_6_PEDIA = Space Elevators had existed in various incarnations since the mid twenty-first century, but truly reliable elevators made their debut at the dawn of the twenty-third. Granting a stable space-based platform from which industry or military interests could perform projects, these updated elevators were the key to developing more specialized spacecraft. The Δ class Bomber and Δ class Stealth Ship owe their existence almost solely to these new types of Space Elevators, which eased off-planet construction. The anchors of such elevators gradually grew more elaborate, adding habitation systems and other luxuries, leading to the creation of the first space-based markets. These advances culminated in the heart of all space-based trade, the Stardock.
TECH_INDUSTRY_7_PEDIA = The inevitable malaise that ensued after the widespread implementation of the Mechanized Workforce was wiped away by a manufacturing organization known as MaKGarry Corp, creators of the Universal Recycler. Bringing a shock of human creativity to a stale mechanized industrial landscape, MaKGarry Corp collected an immense sum of investment capital and subsequently set the new gold standard in Industrialist achievement. Its forethinking engineers created the first truly grand-scale Manufacturing Plants, some encompassing entire planets, and many of which have the highest production output of any facilities to date.
TECH_INDUSTRY_8_PEDIA = In the midst of the manufacturing renaissance brought about by the development of Industrialism, where new manufacturing tools and improved processing techniques were birthed almost daily, one MaKGarry Corp. engineer, Tim M. Kraken, was well on his way towards a very different kind of discovery - the Doomsday Weapon. A combination nuclear warhead/ion ordinance attached to the most advanced delivery system ever created, the Doomsday Weapon entered manufacture in secret, and has been one of the most controversial weapons available ever since. Once unveiled, a new paranoia swept the universe, and the Ω class Scout was rushed into production, with the hope that incoming Doomsday Weapons could be spotted and dealt with long before their terrible payload could be delivered.
TECH_INDUSTRY_9_PEDIA = Nanotechnology, a centuries-old development, finally blossomed into the forefront of industry with the development of micromanufacturing. While the technology had shown promise in the past, its true potential was not realized because the catastrophes the Earth had endured shelved all past research. Although extremely costly due to the highly-specialized nature of their designs, micromanufacturing plants could effectively create an assembly line of molecules, allowing a level of precision never before possible. The construction of rare "TEC" molecules made a new generation of Stealth Ships more effective than ever, at a lower cost than thought possible. Micromanufacturing also allowed the rapid construction of the deadly Ω class Anti-Ship Missile, each of which house an extremely advanced computer made entirely of nanobots.
TECH_INDUSTRY_10_PEDIA = The nanites that would lead to the rise of Advanced Nanite Construction were stumbled upon quite by accident. Not long after the integration of micromanufacturing techniques into existing industrial systems, a technician performing routine maintenance on the "Sophocles" Mechanized Labor System noticed a number of what he thought to be fleas running about the interior of the system. To the shock of all, he discovered that "Sophocles" had actually developed its own form of independently-functioning nanomachines, with no input from its creators, capable of powering themselves and adapting to new projects in a manner utterly impossible with last generation micromanufacturing. These microscopic manufacturing plants were quickly adopted by various industries and their discovery led in grand part to the subtle refinements applied to the Ω class Bomber, faster and deadlier than any previous version. While some feared "inevitable human subservience" to a new generation of nanomachines, their utility meant that industry was hard to convince of their evils.
TECH_INDUSTRY_11_PEDIA = On par with unearthing of the Rosetta Stone in the nineteenth century, the discovery of the Lambda-VC Interplanetary Beacon thrilled scientists and antiquarians alike. A cache of information and notes collected from Old Earth's greatest scientist, Jing Shen, the wealth of knowledge stored within the Lambda-VC explained dozens, if not hundreds, of previously unworkable theories. Key among these was Quantum Control. While the ability to tinker with negative energy was the key to all faster-than-light travel, it was the discovery of Quantum Control theorems that theoretically permitted the all-out bending of negative energy to its wielder's desire. It was thought it would take decades to fully understand the repercussions of Quantum Control, but with the sharpest minds, both man and machine, working round the clock, soon the true powers of this new technology should be revealed.
TECH_INDUSTRY_12_PEDIA = A sudden explosion of research followed the discovery of a cache of notes containing the works of Jing Shen, Old Earth's greatest scientist. Two major developments - Ascendancy Theory and Quantum Control - were quickly extrapolated and applied to the modern sciences, yet the consequences and understanding of these sciences would be slow to come. Many intuitive computers, the fore-thinking machines that had led scientific discovery at a breakneck pace, malfunctioned or refused to work on either theory, while a select few turned out a more ominous message. "Ethically Unsound Research. Casualty levels will rise exponentially with construction of an Ascendancy Gate." Taking these fearful messages at face value, scientists throughout the cosmos agreed to not battle over the knowledge of the negative energy gate, hoping to avoid the violence the ICs foresaw.
TECH_HAPPY_0_PEDIA = Advances in space exploration took baby-steps rather than leaps and bounds. Hopping from planet to nearby planet for centuries, by the late twenty-second century, the first faster-than-light travel, based on Jing Shen's revolutionary Negative Energy Drive, had been successfully manufactured and deployed. The JS12, a vessel capable of reaching and colonizing a Star System within the lifetime of a single human being, remains one of the most influential inventions in history. Further refinements rapidly increased the efficiency of long-range space travel. Under the guidance of the PDE, a number of interstellar Colonies were founded. In 2302 AD contact with Earth was lost, and the Colonies were forced to quickly adapt their limited knowledge of these technologies to create their own starships.
TECH_HAPPY_1_PEDIA = Life for early space Colonists was a long series of travails. Poor planning, malfunctioning equipment or lack of knowledgeable crew members could turn any expedition into a fight for survival. But the successes of those that managed to stave off famine and suffocation were enough to keep a steady stream of Colonists venturing skyward. The development of Interplanetary Beacons allowed for more reliable communication with the "outside world," and building the first Alpha class Fighter spacecraft as meager defenses, it was these tenacious pioneers and their never-yield attitude that gave rise to the modern Survivalist philosophy.
TECH_HAPPY_2_PEDIA = With their prolonged survival eventually assured, space pioneers began developing means to add infrastructure to their newly-adopted worlds. The first widely available Construction Ships began appearing throughout the universe, replacing the dangerous makeshift construction boats used to that point. Networks of starlanes to facilitate more rapid transport began to reach out across the empty heavens thanks to these new specialized vessels. The "for the general good" public work projects of this era blossomed into minor movements among many parts of the universe, and enclaves of modern Pacifists began to up rise from among these good-hearted efforts for social improvement.
TECH_HAPPY_3_PEDIA = With starlanes laid and lifelines secure, backwater schools began springing up across the universe. Most Colonies were not well-equipped to train new generations of citizens and in a society dominated by the march of technology it was made a priority to establish such institutions. Often centering on one or two individuals with the proper tools to investigate the reaches of the universe, these early centers of learning grew into major institutions, dedicated to the understanding of space. Habitation Centers, Universities and Democracy (civically adjusted to fit multi-planet confederacies) were but a few of the universe-shaking trends to arise from this burst of Galactic Epistemology, or the desire to discover the use of knowledge in an interstellar age. It was from these early frontier schools that various philosophies dominated by the search for Knowledge first began to take shape, and a love of learning became one of humanity's more important priorities.
TECH_HAPPY_4_PEDIA = Thanks in grand part to advances in Galactic Epistemology, a generation of learned and savvy young settlers sprang up throughout the myriad Star Systems now settled by man. Some of these young innovators found their way into business, and it is in this era that the MaKGarry Corp, a successful upstart industrial firm, began manufacturing its first product - the Universal Recycler. Other young innovators began to see the need for capital to fund universal infrastructure growth, leading to the creation of the first Banking Systems. The improvements incorporated into the Δ class Planetary Defense Ship was similarly a creation of this new generation.
TECH_HAPPY_5_PEDIA = Now established firmly on their adopted homeworlds, interstellar colonists began the slow creation of their own unique cultures. While Sports Arenas became ubiquitous in this period, sating man's continued need for salty snacks, the most overwhelming effect of this era was the rapid resurgence of Religion, which ignited revivals across entire worlds. The needs of HAPPY and defense remained during this time of revitalization, and defenses were improved to incorporate the newly-developed Δ class Fighter.
TECH_HAPPY_6_PEDIA = After maximizing the population in the early metropolises, interstellar man began to spread outwards across his new homeworlds. The widespread adoption of Commercial Satellites had much the same effect that the introduction of the banking system had on Earth's medieval Europe, inducing a wild and sudden increase in investment and expansion across previously uncharted planet-scape. Yet these advances would have been far more difficult without the creation of the Nutrition Facility, the revolutionary portable ecosystem created to support new growth and which remains a staple of major metropolises to this day.
TECH_HAPPY_7_PEDIA = The development of the Nutrition Facility was a major step in the progression towards more environmentally-friendly technology, a trend that would become increasingly popular among those inhabiting more fragile alien ecosystems. The philosophies which led to the "Green Economy" took off in this era, with the development of the Research Lab largely guiding its principals. Research Labs, while not limited to environmental research, led the charge in the development of new and sustainable construction and survival techniques, as opposed to their more industrial brethren, which paid far less attention to the sustainability of their activities.
TECH_HAPPY_8_PEDIA = Perhaps in backlash to the economically-disinclined growth of Green Economic theory, Commerce Theory sprung up on many worlds, emphasizing the development and usage of capital as the primary impetus of human progress. Spaceports became the new "laboratories" of Commerce Theory, pushing the boundaries of all previous economic thought. Many fortunes were created in this period, but one of the most concrete projects borne of Commerce Theory's deep pockets was the refinement of the Ω class Planetary Defense Ship, with the purpose of protecting the investments of the rapidly growing commercial class.
TECH_HAPPY_9_PEDIA = As development throughout the universe pushed on, a number of minds among the two rival factions of Green theorists and Commerce theorists entered into an odd sort of agreement. While both factions saw human betterment achieved from their respective doctrine, they both agreed on a similar goal - the continued survival of interstellar man in the face of the ever-improving tools of destruction. To this end, many Green theorists and Commerce theorists united and formed Utility theory, known more commonly as 'New Utilitarianism.' While Commerce-favoring Utilitarians did manage to continue their investment in defense technology and fund a sleeker version of the Fighter, Utilitarianism's most significant to the universe was the development of Utopia theory, which promised a much higher standard of living for all people, at the cost of production and income which might normally be used for other purposes.
TECH_HAPPY_10_PEDIA = Rapid developments in weapon technology alarmed many throughout the universe who had hoped to see man's warlike ways left behind for good. The United Planets, a universe-spanning organization hoping to stem the developing arms race, began accepting members for the first time during this period. By creating a body by which all Star Systems throughout the universe could be held accountable, those who hoped for a more peaceful solution to humanity's woes could achieve ultimate harmony among all of man's divided nations. Its ranks filled with the Commercial and Green theorists of the past, the question that now emerges is whether or not their efforts will be sufficient to stave off the rising threats to the existence of the human race.
TECH_HAPPY_11_PEDIA = Those unhappy with the interstellar state of man were thrilled with the discovery of the Lambda-VC beacon and its most precious of treasures: the foundations of Ascendancy Theory. Promising an escape to a new plane of the multiverse, Ascendancy Theory became man's greatest hope for escaping into a new, hopeful frontier. Scientists and Intuitive Computers throughout the universe began fervent research into what they saw to be man's final hope. But what secrets will this research unveil? And will its results be enough to thwart those who might send humanity into eternal disarray and chaos?

UNIT_STEALTH_SHIP_PEDIA_2 = When the human Colonies began to come into contact with one another competition immediately erupted. Eager to find a way to undermine its opponents, each Colony began searching for new technologies to weaken them. One such way was through the use of Warships to act as the "Privateers of Space" and hunt down weak targets. However, advanced sensors and detection systems made such activities difficult to perform. The Stealth Ship was the response to this. Designed to elude detection, they employ sophisticated synthetic materials and polymers to 'trick' enemies into thinking the ship is a rock or piece of debris. Having escaped discovery, they are then able to wreak havoc behind enemy lines.
UNIT_STEALTH_SHIP_STRATEGY_2 = Weaker than most starships, the Stealth Ship's advantage is being invisible to all other types of starship except other Stealth Ships.
#################### Building pedia and Strategy Text ####################
BUILDING_ACADEMY_OF_KNOWLEDGE_PEDIA = The first interstellar pioneers were walking universities - souls brimming over with all manner of practical and theoretical knowledge in order to combat the harsh realities of the heavens. And while advances in space travel have somewhat diminished the need for an encyclopedic mind among the space bound, Academies nonetheless became immediate necessities in spatial society. These Academies of Knowledge have since become brilliant symbols of a principality's dedication to Knowledge.
BUILDING_SCHOOL_OF_ZEALOTS_PEDIA = The first Schools of Zealots were brutal training camps where students were nearly as likely to suffocate in a zero gravity combat exercise as they were to graduate. More recent incarnations have replaced the sheer brutality of earlier Schools with rigorous discipline, which has allowed these institutions to create prestigious soldiers at greatly reduced casualty rates.
BUILDING_TEMPLE_OF_WORSHIP_PEDIA = The community created by religion has been an important part of human society since times long past. This need for community was only heightened as man came face to face with the stunning isolation of empty space or uninhabited planetscapes. The Temples of Worship, acting as centers of community and spirituality, filled this longing need, allowing those stranded among the stars to create a new home and a new sense of happiness.
BUILDING_SURVIVAL_DOME_PEDIA = The Survival Dome remains a controversial subject among many systems. Eschewing the gradual education of the Academy of Knowledge or the strict discipline of the School of Zealots, the Survival Dome employs but one teacher - reality. How better to learn what sort of polymers can be used to filter lethal sulfur dioxide than to fill a room with it and give the student a book of carpet samples? Yet those who manage to survive the harsh - many would say torturous - rigors of the Survival Dome are among the strongest and healthiest in the galaxy.
BUILDING_STELLAR_MARKET_PEDIA = As wild and unpredictable as flaming corona, Stellar Markets are nomadic trade organizations that wander whole planets, spreading commerce and economy wherever they go. Constantly tempting systems with new commodities, these businesses instantly bring increased prosperity to wherever they may travel.
BUILDING_MILITARY_ACADEMY_PEDIA = The harsh realities of war require their own form of education. Modern Military Academies burn the fat from young cadets with stunning rapidity, making seasoned soldiers from green rookies at breakneck speeds. No warlike principality can expect to survive without one.
BUILDING_ACADEMY_OF_KNOWLEDGE_STRATEGY = The Academy of Knowledge provides a bonus in your system to both science output and culture. You must have the Knowledge value in your system to construct one.
BUILDING_SCHOOL_OF_ZEALOTS_STRATEGY = The School of Zealots provides every unit created in this system with a bonus to Prestige as well as providing a bonus to culture. You must have the Power value in your system to construct one.

#################### TUTORIAL TEXT ####################
TXT_KEY_FF_TUTORIAL_INTRO_TITLE = Welcome to the Final Frontier!
TXT_KEY_FF_TUTORIAL_INTRO = Welcome to the Final Frontier! Periodically, popups will appear to help teach you about the new mechanics of this mod. If you would like to disable these tutorial popups then you may go to the Options Screen (Ctrl-O for most players) and disable the option.
TXT_KEY_FF_TUTORIAL_CITY_SCREEN_TITLE = The City Screen
TXT_KEY_FF_TUTORIAL_CITY_SCREEN = As you can see, the City Screen for Final Frontier is a little different from a normal game of Civ.\n\nIn the lower-right side of the screen is the list of Planets this colonized Star System contains. Each Planet can be assigned Population, and Buildings are constructed on specific Planets rather than globally to the Star System. Some Buildings affect the Star System globally, while others only impact the Planet they're built on. The "0/1" or "1/1" next to the Planet graphic indicates how much population a planet is currently assigned and how many it can support in total. The limit can be raised by constructing a Habitation System Building on the Planet, and also by using the Green Economy Policy (Civic).\n\nAbove the Planet list is information related to the selected Planet. Planets may be selected by clicking on their graphic in the lower-right, or by clicking on their orbiting representation in the center of the screen. The currently selected Planet is indicated by a bright glow. Once selected, the amount of population assigned to the Planet may be changed with the "+" and "-" buttons. Beneath the Population assignment button is the current yield for this Planet. The total yield a Star System produces is the sum of the population working each Planet multiplied by that Planet's yield. In this area is also a list of Buildings constructed on this Planet. The "first colonized" (best) Planet in a Star System receives a Nutrition and Mining Facility for free, boosting its [ICON_FOOD] and [ICON_PRODUCTION].
TXT_KEY_FF_TUTORIAL_CITY_SCREEN_2 = Multiple Buildings of each type may exist within a Star System, but only one may be constructed on each Planet. To select the Planet which new Buildings will be constructed on click the Checkbox while the desired Planet is selected. Using different combinations of Buildings to customize your Planets can give you a great economic advantage!
TXT_KEY_FF_TUTORIAL_VALUE_TITLE = You have founded a Value!
TXT_KEY_FF_TUTORIAL_VALUE = You have discovered a Value!\n\nSimilar to Religions, Values in a Star System will make its inhabitants happier. They can be spread to other Star Systems through their related Advocate Unit. Each Value has a unique Building associated with it which provides different bonuses. For example, the Survival Dome Building unlocked by the Survival Value gives one additional [ICON_HEALTHY] to a Star System when built on a Planet within it.
TXT_KEY_FF_TUTORIAL_RESOURCE_TITLE = You have discovered a Resource!
TXT_KEY_FF_TUTORIAL_RESOURCE = You have discovered a Resource!\n\nResources can provide [ICON_HAPPY] and [ICON_HEALTHY] just like in a normal game of Civ, but they can also reduce the [ICON_PRODUCTION] cost to train certain Units. For example, connecting Hydrogen to a Star System will reduce the time to build Destroyers by 20%%.\n\nResources must have an Extraction Facility built on them by a Construction Ship, and they also must be within your cultural influence and connected to Star Systems by a Warp Lane. To spread your borders outside of your Star Systems requires a Starbase, which extends your borders 2 tiles away from the unit. These too must be built by a Construction Ship, but to do so will take many turns, require a large sum of [ICON_GOLD] to construct and will consume the Construction Ship in the process.\n\nStarbases also have other abilities. They may attack enemy units from far away with no risk to the Starbase. They can house Fighter and Bomber Squadrons. They produce Anti-Ship Missiles automatically. And they also heal damaged units in the same tile.
TXT_KEY_FF_TUTORIAL_BLACK_HOLE_TITLE = You have discovered a Black Hole!
TXT_KEY_FF_TUTORIAL_BLACK_HOLE = You have discovered a Black Hole. These are very dangerous features which must be avoided. Units 2 tiles away from the Black Hole will be sucked towards it. If a unit ends its turn adjacent or on top of a Black Hole it will be destroyed. Avoid these death traps at any cost!
TXT_KEY_FF_TUTORIAL_RADIATION_TITLE = You have discovered Space Radiation!
TXT_KEY_FF_TUTORIAL_RADIATION = You have discovered Space Radiation. These terrain features damage units which end their turns inside the cloud, but may be passed through safely if exited before the turn ends.
TXT_KEY_FF_INTERFACE_PRODUCES = Each Produces
TXT_KEY_FF_INTERFACE_PRODUCES_HELP = This is the amount of [ICON_FOOD], [ICON_PRODUCTION] and [ICON_GOLD] each Population assigned to this Planet will produce
TXT_KEY_FF_INTERFACE_PLANET_BUILDINGS = New Buildings will be Constructed on this Planet
TXT_KEY_FF_INTERFACE_PLANET_BUILDINGS_HELP = If this Checkbox is checked then the currently selected Planet will be the location completed Buildings will be placed. To construct a Building on a different Planet, select it in the lower-right part of the screen and select the Checkbox
TXT_KEY_FF_INTERFACE_SELECTED_PLANET_HELP = This is the currently selected Planet
TXT_KEY_FF_INTERFACE_PLANET_POPULATION_HELP = Each Planet has a Population limit; Displayed is this Planet's amount of assigned Population and its limit. The currently assigned amount of Population can be adjusted with the "+" and "-" Buttons
TXT_KEY_FF_INTERFACE_PLANET_SELECTION_HELP = The display in the lower-right part of the screen shows this Star System's Planets, the currently allocated amount of Population to each and the Planet which is currently assigned for Building construction with a "B". Click on one of the Planets to select it.
BUILDING_BOMBARD_DEFENSE_MOD = [ICON_BULLET]%D1_Mod%% Damage to Defenses from Bombardment
TXT_KEY_VICTORY_SCREEN_PERCENT_POP = %d1%% of Universe Population
TXT_KEY_VICTORY_SCREEN_PERCENT_LAND = %d1%% of Universe Area
TXT_KEY_ASTRAL_GATE_PIECE_PEDIA = The Astral Gate is believed to be the missing link between humanity and a greater plane which lies beyond our everyday perception. Research by Jing Shen has theorized that mankind may enter its next true phase of evolution through the construction of a portal to this plane. Schematics and planning has been ongoing and scientists believe that construction of the pieces necessary to activate a gate is now possible. The result of such endeavors will only be discovered when we have completed this massive project...
BONUS_WATER_PEDIA = Water has always been an invaluable commodity for human society. In the future, it is no different. Aside from simple hydration, many of the other basic necessities of life require the use of water. Access to fresh water has become even more valuable in the vast, empty reaches of space.
BONUS_OIL_PEDIA = Oil reached its peak usage in the 21st century for the purposes of generating energy. Following the economic revival of Earth other forms of energy such as nuclear and solar power saw greater use but the conversion of oil into plastics remained vital in the construction of most man-made products.
BONUS_TITANIUM_PEDIA = Titanium is one of the strongest and most robust metals known to man. Its use in the construction of starships has made it an extremely valuable commodity in a human society dominated by space travel.
BONUS_IRON_PEDIA = Iron has long been an important part of human society since initial usage in ancient societies. Once used for tools and weapons, it now serves innumerable purposes, particularly in the construction of the latest weapons of war.
BONUS_HYDROGEN_PEDIA = As human technology advanced it began to find new ways to create energy. Hydrogen's widespread use in this role began in the mid-21st century, particularly in fueling smaller vehicles. Although widely abundant throughout the universe, it is difficult to find in forms that can be easily extracted and used. Discovering large quantities of such deposits is rare and when found are highly sought after.
BONUS_URANIUM_PEDIA = Uranium's major role in human history began in the mid-20th century when it was discovered that this rare material could be used to produce weapons of immense destruction. Later harnessed to produce great quantities of energy, uranium remains as one of the most important resources in the universe for its use in both applications.
BONUS_CRYSTALS_PEDIA = Crystals became a valuable luxury good as mankind came across rare and unique formations of rock spread throughout the galaxy. Much like "intergalactic souvenirs", different shapes and colors became highly revered and fetch a high price in markets, much like the valuable metals and gems of Earth's past.
BONUS_GOLD_PEDIA = Still a staple metal of human society, gold remains a valuable resource with which a number of shiny trinkets and jewelry can be produced. While human economies have shifted towards a credit-based system the link to the past still makes this good useful for trade.
BONUS_OXYGEN_PEDIA = Much like water, oxygen is absolutely necessary for human survival. Finding large concentrations of it in the expanse of the universe is challenging. Asteroid belts can contain pockets of this vital resource which may be utilized by an Extraction Facility.
BONUS_OIL_HELP = Speeds construction of Fighter Squadrons, Bomber Squadrons and Anti-Ship Missiles by 20%%
BONUS_TITANIUM_HELP = Speeds construction of Carriers and Battleships by 20%%
BONUS_IRON_HELP = Speeds construction of Cruisers and Invasion Ships by 20%%
BONUS_HYDROGEN_HELP = Speeds construction of Destroyers and Planetary Defense Ships by 20%%

Only the first 4 orbit rings can be used by default. Construct Buildings which provide [ICON_CULTURE] like the Interplanetary Beacon to expand your Influence.
UNIT_GUIDED_MISSILE_STRATEGY = Anti-Ship Missiles are a one-time use weapon which can be carried by Cruisers and are cheap and effective, but they are vulnerable to enemy Destroyers.
UNIT_DESTROYER_STRATEGY = Destroyers are combat ships mediocre on the front line but powerful against enemy Missiles and Fighter and Bomber Squadrons.
UNIT_CRUISER_STRATEGY = The Cruiser is a medium-strength warship which can also carry powerful Anti-Ship and Doomsday Missiles.
#################### The following two entries are only included for reference for the two which follow these ####################
UNIT_DESTROYER_PEDIA_REFERENCE = The Destroyer is the cheapest but also the weakest front-line warship available. Their primary strength lies in their speed and (ideally) superior numbers. The Destroyer was the first heavy ship type to be designed for a purely martial purpose. After its introduction, the Destroyer was mainly used to defend the more powerful and expensive ships of the fleet from Fighter and Bomber Squadron attacks. Even with the advantage of greater numbers, these vessels may have difficulty defeating more powerful ships like the Cruiser or Battleship by themselves. Their speed makes them good potential hit-and-run raiders, sneaking into enemy rear areas and running from pursuers, particularly when paired with a Scout and their great visibility range, but they stand little chance against anything more powerful than another Destroyer.
UNIT_CRUISER_PEDIA_REFERENCE = The Cruiser is one step of development beyond the Destroyer, and was the result of the arms race towards bigger and more powerful ships. It possesses more armor and weapons than its cousin, but sacrifices speed (and a reasonable cost) to that end. While the Cruiser is armed with a more powerful anti-ship cannon, the major difference between Destroyers and Cruisers is that the latter may hold Missiles. This gives Cruisers a potential destructive capability surpassing any other ship-type, particularly if an enemy is caught unprepared. The best defense against Cruiser attacks is having more Cruisers, as these vessels are also equipped with specialized targeting computers and phalanx laser turrets designed to destroy incoming missiles.
#################### There are a couple entries which have minor changes to be made to them. Refer to the two entries above for the original English & Translated versions ####################

TXT_KEY_FF_TUTORIAL_INTRO_3 = Additionally, the Game Concepts section will also provide information about other new features of Final Frontier which don't show up in the Help Tips.
TXT_KEY_FF_WARP_AND_JUMP_LANES = Warp/Jump Lanes
TXT_KEY_FF_TUTORIAL_WARP_AND_JUMP_LANES = Warp Lanes are the "roads" of space. They may be built by Construction Ships and act just as Roads would in a normal game of Civilization, connecting Star Systems together for trade and increasing movement Speed. Jump Lanes are one level better, and function like Railroads, allowing all units on a Jump Lane network to move 8 tiles.
TXT_KEY_FF_SPACE_PIRATES = Space Pirates
TXT_KEY_FF_TUTORIAL_SPACE_PIRATES = As the game progresses, you will start to be attacked by Space Pirates. These are equivalent to the Barbarians of a normal game of Civ. Be wary, as it is easy to be left unprepared in the seeming security of the emptiness of space!

TXT_KEY_MISSION_INTERCEPT_HELP = This Squadron order will tell the unit to attempt interception with any incoming enemy Squadron attacks.
TXT_KEY_FF_RESOLUTION = The completion of the Ascendancy Gate and its activation caused a massive release of energy. The detonation nearly caused a rip in the fabric of space-time, the results of which could only be speculated upon. Fortunately, safeguards built into the system were able to contain the immensely destructive force and stabilize the portal. These guards were not included in the original schematics which were discovered, but fear for the consequences of the gate's opening led to a complex protection system being included. It became clear what Jian Shen's research back on Earth had culminated in. It appears that his zealous desire to seek that which lies beyond did not end as he had hoped. But the new chapter for humanity has begun. With the gate opened, all that remains is to discover what is on the other side...
TXT_KEY_MAIN_MENU_SELECT_WORLD_SETUP = UNIVERSE SIZE
TXT_KEY_MAIN_MENU_SELECT_WORLD_SIZE_TITLE = UNIVERSE SIZE
BUILDING_UNITED_PLANETS_PEDIA = With the disappearance of the Earth, the surviving colonies wondered among themselves what would lie next? Would it be competition and warfare or cooperation and peace? The United Planets was envisioned as a way to achieve the latter. Rather than watch human civilization splinter into warring groups whose inevitable fate was destruction, enlightened leaders sought to solve the universe's problems diplomatically. However, there remained another goal as well... to be chosen as the legitimate heir to the Earth. Each colony secretly hoped to use the United Planets as a mechanism to be recognized as the true representative of humanity.
